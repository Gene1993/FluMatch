Basically, after genome assembly a script could be written to take the assembled file and Blast the highest depth of coverage contigs ( top 10 or something). 
# This can probably be done using a regex to search coverage data from FASTA header or from a table from Geneious that provides this output 

This could then be put into a table as a quick report (strain ID for each segment).
# Table: Contig ID + strain ID from Top BLAST hit 

~Finally, to take it one step further annotating the contigs based on the BLAST hits and identify the coverage location would be helpful.~
# Done

Yohannes generally is interested in reporting the closest match using BLAST, not the best use of all the data but a fast answer for diagnostic purposes.

# Done. See above

With respect to coverage, Yohannes likes to build phylogenetic trees with the data
# Maybe this should be automated too

So generally once we have the top BLAST hit, we export the nucleotide segments in a FASTA format , preferably in the correct orientation.  
# Double check this

The coordinates of each gene can be useful if we don't achieve full coverage, eg: PB2 233-2310 would be useful if it was not full length so we know what we are missing.
# Parsable from BLAST output

# Algorithm
1. Annotate contigs with Prokka
2. BLAST annotated segments vs. nt or Influenza A virus
3. Report: QueryID, HitID, HitDesc, Range, Coverage
